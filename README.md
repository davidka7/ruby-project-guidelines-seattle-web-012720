# My Final Project Set Up

## Congratulations, your about to immerse into my project!!!
## You'll be able to dive into a multi-universe game of spatial riders.
## You will be able to join the other betters in betting on the Bikers.

### Let me give you a little overview on how to set it up.

#### -Fork and clone this project
#### -run 'Bundle Install' in your terminal
#### -On the command line of your terminal run 'ruby bin/run.rb' to run this file


### Play Time

#### You join a game as better, your ready to bet all your money on your favorite Bikers. You feel confident in yourself and want to check out all the races, there locations, any other details provided, if you reject many op the menu proposals, you'll eventually be kicked out. You are also considered a VIP user. Meaning you can edit the races, change their names "based on your friends (not really) acceptance", or sponsor the race in one of your arenas, you can as well change it location. Probably the coolest thing is you can create your own race, or even bet all your money in hopes of winning much more....but be careful you might lose it allllllllllllllllLL!L!L!L!L!L!L!L!L!L!LL!!
